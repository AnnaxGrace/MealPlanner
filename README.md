## Description
The mental load is an issue that is gaining attention all over the world. It's the mental management of chores and it is it's own chore in and of itself. Our meal-planning website knows that households want to cook and plan together. CookingTogether is a one-stop for meal-planning as a household, and it helps to divide the mental load - and it even takes care of some of it on its own, such as keeping track of the schedule, and dietary restrictions.
